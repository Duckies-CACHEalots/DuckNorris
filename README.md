# DuckNorris
First group exercise @ Academia de Codigo - Terceira Tech Island

Using simpleGFX lib and sound library we created this laberynth where Duck Norris, a rubber duck, needs to find his way to the little star icon that is randomly located throughout the map to end the game succesfully. 

He needs to escape the horrible crocodiles that aim to eat him and can only fight them when powered up.
